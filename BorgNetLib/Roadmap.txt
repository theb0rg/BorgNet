TODO SOMEWHERE SOMEWHEN:
3. DB for Server. Log messages, logins etc
4. DB for Client. Log messages, with common data like Time
5. Break down stuff and make changelogs
6. Replace/Append Logging instead of Console...(Log4Net)


IN PROGRESS: 
1. Userstates in Lib. If a user starts writing a message in client, show "name writing..." 
2. Login/Splashscreen. Make it easy like a simple "connect" and Username. Save username somewhere ? DB?


DONE:
